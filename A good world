This repository will hold all the ideas of good people around the world for any human being to leave happily. Anyone might add his/her wishes of a beatifull
world, the whole community will vote via likes or dislikes and if it reaches a certain number of likes the idea is added to the master branch.

the community will also comment, anyone will say what he/she thinks about the idea; the community discusses about and the vote or improvement to the ideas
are made.

we need to make an application for this project. A chat application, we might use telegram messenger's codes (which already have the function to split group
discussions into topics). What we will only add is to upload the discussion into a central repository for the world to see and aprove.

I think this world is a beautifull place and good people should unite their efforts or ideas to improve life in the world.
alot of times people are free, browsing their phones or pcs looking for new feeds on the internet, when they find topics of discussions, they just talk about
it with closed persons and the debate ends around them.

with this project, any person's point of view will be helpfull to the whole world. they will give their opinions and if it makes sense or if it is a valuable
idea it will be added to the repo and later people will be able to use that opinion of life to improve theirs or adjust their life style.

A concrete example is: Some people have the chance to have elders around them who can provide advices whenever they are confused on a topic or on a situation
in life, but other persons do not have that opportunity they have the unfortunate task of experiencing life blindly.
The idea is very simple (IF YOU HAVE AN ADVICE THAT ANYONE GAVE YOU OR THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT BE HELPFULL TO ANYONE OR EVEN IF YOU CRITICIZE ANYTHING IN LIFE
AND YOU HAVE GOOD REASONS, PLEASE SHARE. SOME PERSONS NEED THOSE ADVICES.

sorry to be selfish but this project will mostly be used in Africa the country that i belong. Here, we are still leaving like in age of stones. If only
we had some information about development techniques, about even what holds us back i think some people will improve.

Everyday i see in my country people carrying food on their head and walking along the whole town to look for buyers. they are tears on my eyes, i have never
traveled but from small videos of developed countries that i watched online i know that this must no more exist in 2022. I also know that people are living
this way because they are not aware that they can do otherwise. So please anyone to help Africans with their knowledge (even criticisms will be of great
help).
